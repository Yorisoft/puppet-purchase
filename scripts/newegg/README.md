# About Newegg puppet purchase bot

Newegg website required that you enter a 6 pin security code - ***sent to email attempting loggin.*** 
This means that additional email credentials are required in order for the puppeteer to retrieve the security code from the email adress.
Rememeber to fill in all required information inside myInfo.js

### Options

As of now I have not found a way to get around the 6 pin security code (only a matter of time before I do).

Not comfortable with inputing your email credentials into a random scripts found online ??? No problem ! Please find one of the other scripts in this repo :)
